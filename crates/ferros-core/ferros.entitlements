        Debugging entitlement required for task_for_pid() and other Mach debugging APIs.
        
        This entitlement allows the debugger to:
        - Attach to other processes using task_for_pid()
        - Read/write memory in other processes
        - Control thread execution in other processes
        
        Without this entitlement, you must run the debugger with sudo.
        
        See: https://developer.apple.com/documentation/bundleresources/entitlements/com.apple.security.cs.debugger
