# Clippy configuration for Ferros
# See https://rust-lang.github.io/rust-clippy/ for more options
#
# Note: Lint groups (like pedantic, nursery, cargo) are configured in Cargo.toml
# This file is for configuring individual lint behavior and thresholds

# Cognitive complexity threshold (default is 25)
# Increase to allow more complex functions before warning
cognitive-complexity-threshold = 30

# Array size threshold for large array warnings
# Arrays larger than this will trigger a warning
array-size-threshold = 50
